    <h1>About Us!</h1>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Modrowsky's Meats and Sandwiches has a long history with a lot of love and effort put behind it. We were founded in September of 2022 in College Station, Texas, by our founder Andrew Modrowsky, who, due to his love of sandwiches and deli meats, created this store to share his passion to the world. While Modrowsky had never been to College Station Texas, and to this day still never has, he believed that the great city should experience his love of sandwiches as well. Modrowsky, despite the store's long and expansive history in the area, continues to operate this store as a part time job along with his studies at Cornell to this very day, even at his old age of 19.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Modrowsky sees a long and expansive future in place for his store, believing that it could continue to sell sandwiches and deli meats to the great city of College Station, Texas for a few more weeks, maybe even a month! He hopes to ensure that everyone gets to enjoy his delicious sandwiches, and to share his love for them all around the world. Andrew once again believes that sandwiches are one of the world's great wonders, and hopes to provide affordable sandwiches to all who enjoy them.</p>
    <h2>About Modrowsky</h2>
