    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Modrowsky!</p>
    <p>I'm currently a rising senior at Cornell University majoring in Information Science. I'm interested in a variety of different topics, especially in data science and social networks.</p>

    <p>At Cornell, I am a research assistant under Professor Brennan Antone in the Robots in Groups Lab, where we investigate network cognition and social network effects using quantitative tools and survey methods.</p>

    <p>I am also involved in Undergraduate Teaching at Cornell, in which I have TA'd two different courses, INFO 2950: Introduction to Data Science (Spring 2024), and INFO 1300: Introduction to Web Programming (Fall 2023). This upcoming Fall, I will also be a teaching assistant for INFO 3350: Text Mining in History and Literature.</p>

    <p>Finally, I am involved in a variety of extracurriculars, including WVBR 93.5 FM, Cornell's Radio, the Cornell International Affairs Society, and a variety of other activities.</p>

    <p>As for the future, who knows. I'm interested in a variety of different career paths, and hope to go to graduate school in the future. If you want more information or a copy of my transcript, please email me at ajmodrowsky@gmail.com.</p>
